# NordHarbor Project State

## Current phase

Architecture planning and initial repository setup.

## Project goal

Build a photography-first digital licensing platform as a practical full-stack software engineering portfolio project.

The first release will support a single photographer. The architecture will be designed and evolved deliberately to learn scalability, maintainability, security and production engineering.

## MVP access rules

- Anonymous visitors may browse galleries and save reduced-resolution previews.
- Customer registration and authentication are required for purchasing licenses.
- Full-resolution edited downloads require a completed purchase and backend authorization.
- Original RAW files remain private.
- Payments will initially operate in test mode.
- Commercial and resale licensing requests will be handled through direct inquiry.

## Development environment

- Windows 11 with WSL Ubuntu
- Development repositories stored in the Linux filesystem
- Node.js 24 managed through nvm
- npm 11
- Git and GitHub SSH configured
- Domain: elmongytech.com
- Repository hosted on GitHub

## Accepted decisions

- Single-photographer first release, with future marketplace expansion.
- Photography-first, cinematic user experience.
- Full-resolution edited image delivery; RAW files remain private.
- Security-first engineering and controlled local penetration-testing exercises.
- Complete test-payment and digital fulfillment workflow before real payments.
- Commercial and resale licensing through direct inquiry.
- Monorepo with independent frontend and backend applications.
- Feature-based organization emphasizing high cohesion, low coupling and traceable data flow.

## Preferred technology stack

- Frontend: Next.js, React and TypeScript
- Backend: NestJS and TypeScript
- Database: PostgreSQL
- Styling: SCSS Modules
- Monorepo tooling: npm workspaces
- Local development: WSL Ubuntu
- Containers: Docker / Docker Compose

Framework choices will be validated through small practical implementations.

## Proposed repository structure

```text
nordharbor/
├── apps/
│   ├── web/
│   └── api/
├── docs/
├── package.json
└── README.md
```

## Still undecided

- Detailed MVP feature boundaries
- ORM or SQL database-access strategy
- Object-storage provider and image-processing approach
- Authentication implementation
- Payment provider
- Hosting and deployment architecture
- CI/CD configuration


## Development workflow

- Use VS Code GUI for creating files and folders, staging, committing and pushing.
- Use the WSL terminal for package management, application execution, Docker, databases and meaningful command-line learning.
- Explain unfamiliar commands, syntax and framework concepts before using them.
- Implement features manually with ChatGPT acting as mentor and reviewer.
- Favor readable code, high cohesion, low coupling and traceable data flow.

## Initial implementation

**Vertical slice 001: Public photo gallery**

Build a read-only gallery using Next.js and NestJS, initially backed by hardcoded photo metadata.

Then evolve the feature to use PostgreSQL and appropriate image storage.

**Current implementation status:**

- npm workspaces monorepo configured.
- `apps/web` initialized with Next.js, React and TypeScript.
- `apps/api` initialized with NestJS, TypeScript and ESM.
- Root development scripts start the web app, API, or both applications together.
- Next.js runs on port `3000`.
- NestJS API runs on port `3001`.
- Swagger/OpenAPI documentation is available from the API.
- Production dependency audit currently reports zero known vulnerabilities.
- `PhotosModule` is implemented as the first real NestJS feature module.
- `PhotosController` handles the public photo HTTP routes.
- `PhotosService` owns the temporary hardcoded photo data and lookup/filtering logic.
- `GET /photos` returns all photo metadata.
- `GET /photos?category=...` filters the photo collection case-insensitively.
- `GET /photos/:slug` returns an individual photo.
- Unknown photo slugs return `404 Not Found`.
- Empty category filters return an empty collection rather than `404`.
- Photo metadata currently uses Instagram post URLs as temporary external references while the real preview/storage architecture remains intentionally deferred.

## Current task

Complete the API contract for vertical slice 001 using DTO classes and richer Swagger/OpenAPI documentation.

The first frontend/backend connection is now working.

## Current implementation status

In addition to the existing backend Photos feature:

- Next.js `/photos` fetches photo metadata from the NestJS API.
- Next.js `/photos/[slug]` fetches an individual photo by slug.
- Internal navigation between collection and detail pages works using Next.js `Link`.
- `/photos?category=...` forwards category filtering to the NestJS API.
- Category values are URL-encoded before being added to the API request.
- Empty filtered collections render a normal empty state.
- Missing individual photo resources remain a separate `404` concern.
- Duplicate frontend fetch logic has been removed.

## Exact next step

Introduce DTO classes and improve Swagger/OpenAPI documentation for the Photos API.

Focus on:

- runtime DTO classes
- response schemas
- `@ApiTags`
- `@ApiOperation`
- `@ApiQuery`
- `@ApiParam`
- `@ApiOkResponse`
- `@ApiNotFoundResponse`
- representative examples

After the Photos API contract is documented clearly, prepare for PostgreSQL persistence.

Before considering the Photos API contract complete, perform a focused Swagger/OpenAPI documentation pass:

- add meaningful API tags
- add endpoint summaries and descriptions
- document optional query parameters
- document path parameters
- document success responses
- document expected `404` responses
- introduce response DTO classes where useful for OpenAPI schemas
- add representative examples

## Next session

1. Review the generated Next.js App Router structure.
2. Create the `/photos` page.
3. Fetch `GET /photos` from the NestJS API.
4. Render the returned metadata with minimal markup.
5. Add basic loading/error handling as appropriate.
6. Confirm the full flow from Next.js → NestJS → `PhotosService`.
7. Then begin `/photos/[slug]`.
