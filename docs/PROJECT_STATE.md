# NordHarbor Project State

## Current phase

Architecture planning and initial repository setup.

## Project goal

Build a photography-first digital licensing platform as a practical full-stack software engineering portfolio project.

The first release will support a single photographer. The architecture will be designed and evolved deliberately to learn scalability, maintainability, security and production engineering.

## MVP access rules

- Anonymous visitors may browse galleries and save reduced-resolution previews.
- Customer registration and authentication are required for purchasing licenses.
- Full-resolution edited downloads require a completed purchase and backend authorization.
- Original RAW files remain private.
- Payments will initially operate in test mode.
- Commercial and resale licensing requests will be handled through direct inquiry.

## Development environment

- Windows 11 with WSL Ubuntu
- Development repositories stored in the Linux filesystem
- Node.js 24 managed through nvm
- npm 11
- Git and GitHub SSH configured
- Domain: elmongytech.com
- Repository hosted on GitHub

## Accepted decisions

- Single-photographer first release, with future marketplace expansion.
- Photography-first, cinematic user experience.
- Full-resolution edited image delivery; RAW files remain private.
- Security-first engineering and controlled local penetration-testing exercises.
- Complete test-payment and digital fulfillment workflow before real payments.
- Commercial and resale licensing through direct inquiry.
- Monorepo with independent frontend and backend applications.
- Feature-based organization emphasizing high cohesion, low coupling and traceable data flow.

## Preferred technology stack

- Frontend: Next.js, React and TypeScript
- Backend: NestJS and TypeScript
- Database: PostgreSQL
- Styling: SCSS Modules
- Monorepo tooling: npm workspaces
- Local development: WSL Ubuntu
- Containers: Docker / Docker Compose

Framework choices will be validated through small practical implementations.

## Proposed repository structure

```text
nordharbor/
├── apps/
│   ├── web/
│   └── api/
├── docs/
├── package.json
└── README.md
```

## Still undecided

- Detailed MVP feature boundaries
- ORM or SQL database-access strategy
- Object-storage provider and image-processing approach
- Authentication implementation
- Payment provider
- Hosting and deployment architecture
- CI/CD configuration


## Development workflow

- Use VS Code GUI for creating files and folders, staging, committing and pushing.
- Use the WSL terminal for package management, application execution, Docker, databases and meaningful command-line learning.
- Explain unfamiliar commands, syntax and framework concepts before using them.
- Implement features manually with ChatGPT acting as mentor and reviewer.
- Favor readable code, high cohesion, low coupling and traceable data flow.

## Initial implementation

**Vertical slice 001: Public photo gallery**

Build a read-only gallery using Next.js and NestJS, initially backed by hardcoded photo metadata.

Then evolve the feature to use PostgreSQL and appropriate image storage.

**Current implementation status:**

- npm workspaces monorepo configured.
- `apps/web` initialized with Next.js, React and TypeScript.
- `apps/api` initialized with NestJS, TypeScript and ESM.
- Root development scripts added for starting web, API, or both applications.
- Next.js runs on port `3000`.
- NestJS API runs on port `3001`.
- Swagger/OpenAPI documentation is available from the API.
- Production dependency audit currently reports zero known vulnerabilities.

## Current task

Begin vertical slice 001 by implementing the first real backend feature using NestJS feature modules.

## Exact next step

Create a `PhotosModule` with its own controller and service, then expose a read-only `GET /photos` endpoint backed by hardcoded photo metadata.

Use this first feature to practice NestJS module boundaries, dependency injection, controller/service responsibilities and Swagger documentation before introducing PostgreSQL.

## Next session

1. Create `PhotosModule`.
2. Add `PhotosController`.
3. Add `PhotosService`.
4. Register `PhotosModule` in `AppModule`.
5. Return hardcoded photo metadata from `GET /photos`.
6. Document the endpoint in Swagger.
7. Test the endpoint in Swagger and Postman.
